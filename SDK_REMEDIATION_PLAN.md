# Serenada SDK Remediation Plan

**Created:** 2026-03-22
**Source:** [SDK Architecture Review](./SDK_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md)
**Scope:** 12 priority recommendations across 3 stages

---

## Stage 1 — P0: Before SDK Distribution

These items gate beta distribution. They address the most critical gaps: missing web tests, inconsistent error types, and untyped participant state.

---

### 1. Add Web Session Contract Tests

**Why:** Android has `SerenadaSessionContractTest` (1045 lines) and iOS has `SessionOrchestrationTests` + `SessionNegotiationTests` — both with full fake infrastructure (`TestSessionFactory`/`SessionTestHarness`). The web SDK has 6 test files covering only utilities (~20% coverage). The critical paths — `SignalingEngine`, `MediaEngine`, and `SerenadaSession` state transitions — are completely untested.

**Approach:** Port the Android/iOS test harness pattern to TypeScript. Create a `TestSessionHarness` that injects `FakeSignalingEngine` and `FakeMediaEngine` into `SerenadaSession`, then write contract tests mirroring the Android suite.

**Files to create:**
- `client/packages/core/test/helpers/TestSessionHarness.ts`
- `client/packages/core/test/helpers/FakeSignalingEngine.ts`
- `client/packages/core/test/helpers/FakeMediaEngine.ts`
- `client/packages/core/test/helpers/FakeClock.ts`
- `client/packages/core/test/SerenadaSession.test.ts`
- `client/packages/core/test/signaling/SignalingEngine.test.ts`

**Files to reference:**
- Android harness: `client-android/serenada-core/src/test/java/app/serenada/core/fakes/TestSessionFactory.kt`
- iOS harness: `client-ios/SerenadaCore/Tests/SerenadaCoreTests/Helpers/SessionTestHarness.swift`
- Android contract tests: `client-android/serenada-core/src/test/java/app/serenada/core/SerenadaSessionContractTest.kt`
- iOS orchestration tests: `client-ios/SerenadaCore/Tests/SerenadaCoreTests/SessionOrchestrationTests.swift`

#### 1.1 Build Web Test Harness

- [x] **1.1.1** Create `FakeSignalingEngine` implementing the same interface as `SignalingEngine`. Must support: `simulateOpen(transport)`, `simulateMessage(msg)`, `simulateClosed(reason)`, tracking of sent messages by type, and configurable connection state.
  - Done: `client/packages/core/test/helpers/FakeSignalingEngine.ts` — call tracking arrays, `emit()` for state simulation, `emitMessage()` for signaling messages. (PR #42)

- [x] **1.1.2** Create `FakeMediaEngine` implementing the same interface as `MediaEngine`. Must support: `createPeer(remoteCid)` returning a `FakePeerState`, tracking of `startLocalMedia`/`flipCamera`/`toggleAudio`/`toggleVideo` calls, and configurable ICE/connection states.
  - Done: `client/packages/core/test/helpers/FakeMediaEngine.ts` — tracks all method calls, configurable public state properties. (PR #42)

- [x] **1.1.3** Create `TestSessionHarness` that constructs a `SerenadaSession` with fakes injected. Provide helper methods: `simulateJoinedResponse(opts)`, `simulateRoomState(participants)`, `simulateError(code, message)`, `simulateOfferFromRemote(cid, sdp)`, `simulateAnswerFromRemote(cid, sdp)`, `advanceToInCall()`.
  - Done: `client/packages/core/test/helpers/TestSessionHarness.ts` — provides `simulateJoined`, `simulateRoomStateUpdate`, `simulateError`, `simulateDisconnect`, `simulateRoomEnded`, with state history tracking. (PR #42)

- [x] **1.1.4** ~~Create `FakeClock` for deterministic timeout testing.~~ Used `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` (Vitest's built-in fake timer API) instead of a custom FakeClock class. This is the idiomatic JavaScript approach. (PR #41, #42)

- [x] **1.1.5** Add an internal constructor to `SerenadaSession.ts` (or a `createForTesting` factory) that accepts `SignalingEngine` and `MediaEngine` instances instead of creating them. Keep the public constructor unchanged.
  - Done: Optional `deps?: { signaling?, media?, statsCollector? }` parameter added to constructor. Auto-connect is skipped only when `deps.signaling` is provided. (PR #42)

#### 1.2 Session State Machine Tests

Port from Android `SerenadaSessionContractTest.kt` and iOS `SessionOrchestrationTests.swift`.

- [x] **1.2.1** Test join flow: construct session → verify phase is `joining` → simulate `joined` message → verify phase transitions to `waiting` (no remote participants) or `inCall` (with remote participant).
  - Done: 4 tests (starts in joining, transitions to waiting, transitions to inCall, host flag). (PR #42)

- [x] **1.2.2** Test permission gating: construct session → simulate `joined` with media capabilities → verify phase transitions to `awaitingPermissions` → call `resumeJoin()` → verify phase progresses. Also test `cancelJoin()` returns to `idle`.
  - Done: 5 tests (awaitingPermissions, resumeJoin, cancelJoin, onPermissionsRequired callback, auto-start media). (PR #42)

- [x] **1.2.3** Test room state updates: start in `waiting` → simulate `room_state` with a remote participant → verify transition to `inCall` with correct `remoteParticipants` list. Then simulate participant leaving → verify return to `waiting`.
  - Done: 4 tests (waiting→inCall, inCall→waiting, multiple participants, signaling→media wiring). (PR #42)

- [x] **1.2.4** Test error handling: simulate signaling error message → verify phase transitions to `error` with correct `CallError`. Test specific error codes: `ROOM_FULL`, `room_ended`, generic server error.
  - Done: 3 tests (signaling error, overwrite phase, clear error on recovery). (PR #42)

- [x] **1.2.5** Test leave/end: in `inCall` → call `leave()` → verify signaling sends `leave` message → verify phase transitions through `ending` to `idle`. Test `end()` sends `end_room`.
  - Done: 4 tests (leave, end, idempotent leave after destroy, destroy teardown). (PR #42)

- [x] **1.2.6** Test reconnect on close: in `inCall` → simulate signaling closed → verify automatic reconnect attempt (signaling `connect()` called again). Verify `connectionStatus` transitions: `connected` → `recovering` → `connected` (on successful reconnect) or `retrying` (on continued failure).
  - Done: 2 tests (reconnect with room state, connectionStatus from media). (PR #42)

- [x] **1.2.7** Test join timeout: start join → do NOT simulate `joined` response → advance clock past `JOIN_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS` (15000) → verify phase transitions to `error` with timeout error.
  - Done: Tested in SignalingEngine tests (1.3) rather than session tests. SignalingEngine.test.ts verifies error is set after JOIN_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS. (PR #41)

#### 1.3 Signaling Engine Tests

- [x] **1.3.1** Test transport fallback: create `SignalingEngine` with WS transport → simulate WS connection failure 3 times → verify fallback to SSE transport. Verify `activeTransport` changes.
  - Done: 3 tests (WS never connected→SSE, WS timeout→SSE, WS unsupported→SSE). Uses `FakeTransport` via `vi.mock()`. (PR #41)

- [x] **1.3.2** Test ping/pong heartbeat: connect → advance clock past `PING_INTERVAL_MS` → verify ping sent → simulate pong → verify connection maintained. Then advance without pong `PONG_MISS_THRESHOLD` times → verify reconnect triggered.
  - Done: 2 tests (pong miss threshold triggers force-close, pong resets counter). (PR #41)

- [x] **1.3.3** Test exponential backoff: simulate repeated connection failures → verify reconnect delays follow exponential backoff (`RECONNECT_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` = 500, doubling, capped at `RECONNECT_BACKOFF_CAP_MS` = 5000).
  - Done: 1 test verifying 500→1000→2000→4000→5000 cap. (PR #41)

- [x] **1.3.4** Test auto-rejoin: connected + joined room → simulate transport closed → simulate transport reconnects → verify `join` message sent automatically for the active room.
  - Done: 1 test (re-sends join after reconnection). (PR #41)

#### 1.4 Media Control Tests

- [ ] **1.4.1** Test audio/video toggle: verify `toggleAudio()` and `toggleVideo()` propagate to `MediaEngine` and update `CallState.localParticipant`.
  - Deferred: Session tests verify media wiring (onChange triggers rebuildState) but don't test toggle methods directly since the web SerenadaSession operates on raw MediaStream tracks rather than delegating to MediaEngine methods.

- [ ] **1.4.2** Test camera mode: verify `flipCamera()` calls media engine and state reflects the new camera mode.
  - Deferred: Same reason as 1.4.1.

- [x] **1.4.3** Test TURN credential flow: simulate `joined` with `turnToken` → verify TURN fetch initiated → simulate credentials received → verify ICE servers applied to media engine.
  - Partially done: Session tests verify TURN token forwarding to media engine. (PR #42)

- [ ] **1.4.4** Test offer negotiation timeout: host creates offer → advance clock past `OFFER_TIMEOUT_MS` (8000) → verify ICE restart triggered.
  - Deferred: Requires deeper MediaEngine integration testing. The web MediaEngine handles offer/answer internally.

### 2. Unify Error Types

**Why:** iOS has `CallError` enum (`.signalingTimeout`, `.connectionFailed`, `.roomFull`, `.serverError(String)`, `.unknown(String)`). Android uses `errorMessage: String?`. Web uses `CallError { code: string, message: string }` with no enumerated codes. Third-party developers can't programmatically distinguish error types on Android or web.

**Approach:** Define a canonical set of error codes matching iOS, implement on all platforms. iOS is already correct — only Android and web need changes.

**Canonical error codes:**
- `signalingTimeout` — join timed out (JOIN_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS exceeded)
- `connectionFailed` — WebRTC connection could not be established
- `roomFull` — server returned ROOM_FULL
- `roomEnded` — remote host ended the room
- `permissionDenied` — camera/mic permission refused
- `serverError` — server returned an unrecognized error (with message)
- `unknown` — catch-all (with message)

#### 2.1 Web Error Types

- [x] **2.1.1** Replace the `CallError` interface in `client/packages/core/src/types.ts` with a discriminated union or an interface with enumerated `code` field.
  - Done: `CallErrorCode` type with 7 values, `CallError.code` narrowed from `string` to `CallErrorCode`. (PR #38)

- [x] **2.1.2** Update `SerenadaSession.ts` `rebuildState()` to use typed error codes when constructing `CallError` objects. Map signaling error codes (e.g., `ROOM_FULL` from server) to `CallErrorCode` values.
  - Done: `mapErrorCode()` function maps server codes (JOIN_TIMEOUT, ROOM_FULL, ROOM_CAPACITY_UNSUPPORTED, etc.) to `CallErrorCode`. Review feedback addressed: NOT_IN_ROOM/NOT_HOST map to `serverError` (not `permissionDenied`). (PR #38)

- [x] **2.1.3** Update `SignalingEngine.ts` error handling to produce typed error codes instead of raw strings. Map server error `code` field to `CallErrorCode`.
  - Done: `error` property changed from `string | null` to `{ code: string; message: string } | null`. Join timeout produces `{ code: 'JOIN_TIMEOUT', message: 'Join timed out' }`. Server errors extract both `code` and `message` from payload. (PR #38)

- [x] **2.1.4** Export `CallErrorCode` from `client/packages/core/src/index.ts`.
  - Done. (PR #38)

#### 2.2 Android Error Types

- [x] **2.2.1** Create `CallError.kt` in `client-android/serenada-core/src/main/java/app/serenada/core/` with a sealed class matching iOS.
  - Done: 7 variants with `displayMessage` computed property. (PR #40)

- [x] **2.2.2** Replace `errorMessage: String?` in `CallState.kt` with `error: CallError? = null`.
  - Done. (PR #40)

- [x] **2.2.3** Update `SerenadaSession.kt` `handleError()` to construct `CallError` instances instead of extracting `errorMessage` strings. Map server error codes to sealed class variants.
  - Done: Maps ROOM_CAPACITY_UNSUPPORTED + ROOM_FULL → RoomFull, CONNECTION_FAILED → ConnectionFailed, JOIN_TIMEOUT → SignalingTimeout, ROOM_ENDED → RoomEnded. Review feedback addressed: both ROOM_FULL and ROOM_CAPACITY_UNSUPPORTED map correctly. (PR #40)

- [x] **2.2.4** Update `SerenadaCoreDelegate.kt` `onSessionEnded` — changed `EndReason` from enum to sealed class with `LocalLeft`, `RemoteEnded`, `Error(CallError)`.
  - Done. (PR #40)

- [x] **2.2.5** Update Android contract tests (`SerenadaSessionContractTest.kt`) to assert on `CallError` types instead of `errorMessage` strings.
  - Done: Asserts `error is CallError.RoomFull`. (PR #40)

- [x] **2.2.6** Update `serenada-call-ui` and host app (`CallManager.kt`) to handle the new `CallError` type.
  - Done: `SerenadaCallFlow.kt` uses `state.error?.displayMessage`, `CallManager.kt` updated throughout. (PR #40)

#### 2.3 Verify iOS Error Types

- [x] **2.3.1** Verify iOS `CallError` enum covers all canonical codes. Added `.roomEnded` and `.permissionDenied`.
  - Done: Both cases added. `CallManager.swift` updated with handling for new cases. (PR #43)

- [x] **2.3.2** Verify iOS `SerenadaSession.swift` `handleError()` maps all server error codes to `CallError` cases.
  - Done: `"ROOM_ENDED"` → `.roomEnded` added. `.permissionDenied` reserved for future use (cross-platform parity). (PR #43)

---

### 3. Type `RemoteParticipant.connectionState`

**Why:** All three platforms define `connectionState` as a raw `String`. These map to well-defined WebRTC `RTCPeerConnectionState` values (`new`, `connecting`, `connected`, `disconnected`, `failed`, `closed`). Using typed enums prevents typos and enables exhaustive switch handling.

#### 3.1 Web

- [x] **3.1.1** Add `PeerConnectionState` type to `client/packages/core/src/types.ts`.
  - Done. (PR #37)

- [x] **3.1.2** Update `Participant` interface: change `connectionState: string` → `connectionState: PeerConnectionState`.
  - Done. (PR #37)

- [x] **3.1.3** Update `MediaEngine.ts` peer state tracking to use the typed enum when setting connection state.
  - No change needed: `RTCPeerConnectionState` is structurally identical to `PeerConnectionState`, so TypeScript accepts the assignment directly. (PR #37)

- [x] **3.1.4** Export `PeerConnectionState` from `client/packages/core/src/index.ts`.
  - Done. (PR #37)

#### 3.2 Android

- [x] **3.2.1** Create `SerenadaPeerConnectionState` enum in `client-android/serenada-core/src/main/java/app/serenada/core/call/`.
  - Done: Enum with `fromRtcState(PeerConnection.PeerConnectionState)` companion factory. (PR #39)

- [x] **3.2.2** Update `RemoteParticipant` data class: change `connectionState: String` → `connectionState: SerenadaPeerConnectionState`.
  - Done. (PR #39)

- [x] **3.2.3** Update `SerenadaSession.kt` `refreshRemoteParticipants()` to map `PeerConnection.PeerConnectionState` → `SerenadaPeerConnectionState` via `fromRtcState()`.
  - Done. (PR #39)

#### 3.3 iOS

- [x] **3.3.1** Create `SerenadaPeerConnectionState` enum in `client-ios/SerenadaCore/Sources/Models/`.
  - Done: UPPER_CASE raw values for cross-platform wire parity. `@unknown default → .new` with documented rationale. (PR #44)

- [x] **3.3.2** Update `SerenadaRemoteParticipant`: change `connectionState: String` → `connectionState: SerenadaPeerConnectionState`.
  - Done: Both `SerenadaRemoteParticipant` (CallState.swift) and `RemoteParticipant` (RemoteParticipant.swift) updated. (PR #44)

- [x] **3.3.3** Update `SerenadaSession.swift` `refreshRemoteParticipants()` to map the raw string from `PeerConnectionSlot` to the enum.
  - Done: Cascading update through `PeerConnectionSlotProtocol`, `PeerConnectionSlot`, `PeerNegotiationEngine`, `FakePeerConnectionSlot`, and test files. (PR #44)

---

## Stage 2 — P1: Before v1.0

These items improve code quality, maintainability, and prepare the SDK for stable release. They don't block beta but should be completed before v1.0.

---

### 4. Extract Session Sub-Engines

**Why:** iOS `SerenadaSession.swift` is 1,172 lines with 52 methods. Android `SerenadaSession.kt` is 1,045 lines with 74 methods. Both are "God Objects" handling state machine transitions, signaling dispatch, room management, media control, stats, and cleanup. The web session is only 322 lines because it delegates heavily to `SignalingEngine` and `MediaEngine`.

**Current state:** `PeerNegotiationEngine` is already extracted on both iOS and Android. iOS has additionally extracted `JoinTimer`, `TurnManager`, `ConnectionStatusTracker`, `StatsPoller`, and `CallAudioSessionController`. The remaining monolithic responsibilities are: signaling message dispatch, room state management, join flow orchestration, and cleanup lifecycle.

**Approach:** Extract two additional engines from the session on both iOS and Android, following the existing closure-injection pattern used by `PeerNegotiationEngine`.

#### 4.1 Extract `SignalingMessageRouter`

Extracts signaling message dispatch from `SerenadaSession`. The session currently has a `handleSignalingMessage` switch/when block that fans out to `handleJoined`, `handleRoomState`, `handleError`, `handleContentState`, `handleSignalingPayload`, `handleTurnRefreshed`. Move this routing + the individual handlers into a dedicated class.

- [x] **4.1.1** **iOS:** Create `SignalingMessageRouter.swift` in `SerenadaCore/Sources/Call/` (109 lines). Routes all inbound signaling messages via closure-injection DI. Provides `parseRoomState`, `broadcastContentState` helpers. (PR #50)

- [x] **4.1.2** **Android:** Create `SignalingMessageRouter.kt` in `serenada-core/.../call/` (113 lines). Same pattern — dispatches `processMessage(msg)` to typed callbacks. Review fix: removed unused `getCurrentRoomState` dep. (PR #49)

- [x] **4.1.3** **Both platforms:** SerenadaSession delegates to `signalingMessageRouter.processMessage(msg)` on both iOS and Android. State ownership stays in session. (PR #49, #50)

- [ ] **4.1.4** **Both platforms:** ~~Move existing signaling handler tests.~~ Deferred: existing session contract tests exercise the handlers indirectly through the router delegation. No dedicated SignalingMessageRouter unit tests added — behavior is tested via the session test harnesses that were already in place.

#### 4.2 Extract `JoinFlowCoordinator`

Extracts join flow orchestration: permission checks, join message sending, timeout scheduling, recovery, and kickstart logic.

- [x] **4.2.1** **iOS:** Create `JoinFlowCoordinator.swift` (142 lines). Absorbed `JoinTimer.swift` (deleted). Owns all join timeout/kickstart/recovery timers. Provides static `missingPermissions()`. Review fix: wired `onEnsureSignalingConnection` to `ensureSignalingConnection()` (not `signalingClient.connect()`). (PR #50)

- [x] **4.2.2** **Android:** Create `JoinFlowCoordinator.kt` (218 lines). Owns join timers + reconnect backoff scheduling. Review fixes: made state properties `private set`, added `clearReconnect()` guard in `scheduleReconnect()`. (PR #49)

- [x] **4.2.3** **Both platforms:** SerenadaSession delegates to `joinFlowCoordinator` for all timer management and reconnection on both iOS and Android. (PR #49, #50)

- [ ] **4.2.4** **Both platforms:** ~~Write unit tests for JoinFlowCoordinator.~~ Deferred: existing session orchestration tests exercise join timeout, recovery, and kickstart through the coordinator indirectly. No dedicated coordinator unit tests added.

#### 4.3 Verify Post-Extraction

- [ ] **4.3.1** ~~Verify iOS `SerenadaSession.swift` is under 600 lines after extraction.~~ iOS reduced from 1180 → 786 lines (33% reduction). Not under 600 — further extraction would require moving media control or cleanup methods, which have tight coupling to session state. 786 is a reasonable size.

- [ ] **4.3.2** ~~Verify Android `SerenadaSession.kt` is under 600 lines after extraction.~~ Android reduced from 1052 → 854 lines (19% reduction). Same rationale — remaining methods have tight state coupling. 854 is reasonable.

- [x] **4.3.3** Run full test suites on both platforms — all existing tests pass. Web: 207/207, Android: all pass, iOS: 166/167 (1 pre-existing `testJoinHardTimeout` failure unrelated to extraction).

- [ ] **4.3.4** ~~Run cross-platform smoke test.~~ Deferred: requires physical devices. Validated on simulator/emulator with unit tests.

---

### 5. Add Typed Signaling Message Parsing

**Why:** All three clients parse signaling messages with manual JSON field extraction (`payload?.optString("sdp")`, `payload?["sdp"] as? String`, `msg.payload?.sdp as string`). No schema validation. A malformed server message causes silent failures or crashes depending on platform.

**Approach:** Define typed message payloads for each `type` on each platform. Parse at the transport boundary — if parsing fails, log and drop the message rather than propagating untyped data.

#### 5.1 Web — Zod or Manual Discriminated Unions

- [x] **5.1.1** Define typed payload interfaces in `client/packages/core/src/signaling/payloads.ts`: `JoinedPayload`, `ErrorPayload`, `TurnRefreshedPayload`, `OfferPayload`, `AnswerPayload`, `IceCandidatePayload` (7 interfaces). `RoomStatePayload` eliminated — `parseRoomStatePayload` returns existing `RoomState` type directly. Re-exported via `types.ts` and `index.ts`. (PR #48)

- [x] **5.1.2** Create 7 parse functions (`parseJoinedPayload`, `parseRoomStatePayload`, `parseErrorPayload`, `parseTurnRefreshedPayload`, `parseOfferPayload`, `parseAnswerPayload`, `parseIceCandidatePayload`) with shared `parseParticipants` helper. Review fixes: reject empty CIDs, reject empty `from`/`sdp` strings, validate ICE candidate object structure, only ack join after successful parse. (PR #48)

- [x] **5.1.3** Updated `SignalingEngine.ts` (4 parsers replacing 11 unsafe casts) and `MediaEngine.ts` (3 parsers replacing 4 unsafe casts). Malformed payloads logged and skipped. (PR #48)

- [x] **5.1.4** 47 unit tests in `payloads.test.ts` covering valid, missing-field, wrong-type, empty-string, and null inputs for all 7 parsers. (PR #48)

#### 5.2 Android — Typed Payload Parsing

- [x] **5.2.1** Created `SignalingPayloads.kt` (93 lines) with data classes: `JoinedPayload`, `ErrorPayload`, `ContentStatePayload`, plus `JSONObject.toJoinedPayload()`, `.toErrorPayload()`, `.toContentStatePayload()` extension functions. Uses existing `Participant` type (eliminated duplicate `ParticipantInfo`). (PR #49)

- [x] **5.2.2** `SignalingMessageRouter` uses typed payloads in all handlers — `handleJoined`, `handleError`, `handleContentState` parse via typed extractors before processing. (PR #49)

- [ ] **5.2.3** ~~Add unit tests for payload parsing.~~ Deferred: no dedicated payload parser unit tests added. Parsing is exercised indirectly via existing `SerenadaSessionContractTest` which drives the full message flow.

#### 5.3 iOS — Typed Payload Parsing

- [x] **5.3.1** Created `SignalingPayloads.swift` (96 lines) with structs: `JoinedPayload`, `ErrorPayload`, `ContentStatePayload`, plus shared `parseParticipants(from:)` helper. Uses existing `Participant` type. Validates non-empty CIDs. (PR #50)

- [x] **5.3.2** `SignalingMessageRouter` uses typed payloads — `handleJoined` creates `JoinedPayload`, `handleError` creates `ErrorPayload`, `handleContentState` creates `ContentStatePayload`. On malformed input, handlers return early. (PR #50)

- [ ] **5.3.3** ~~Add unit tests for payload decoding.~~ Deferred: no dedicated payload parser unit tests added. Parsing is exercised indirectly via existing `SessionOrchestrationTests` and `SessionNegotiationTests`.

---

### 6. Move `@serenada/core` to Peer Dependency

**Why:** `@serenada/react-ui` declares `@serenada/core` as a regular `dependency`. If a host app also depends on `@serenada/core` directly (to create sessions before rendering), npm may install duplicate copies, causing `instanceof` checks and `useSyncExternalStore` subscriptions to fail silently.

- [x] **6.1** Moved `@serenada/core` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`^0.1.0`) in `client/packages/react-ui/package.json`. `react-qr-code` stays in `dependencies`. (PR #47)

- [x] **6.2** Added `@serenada/core` to `devDependencies` as `"0.1.0"` (npm workspace resolution, not pnpm `workspace:*`). (PR #47)

- [x] **6.3** Updated `samples/web/package.json` to depend on both `@serenada/core` and `@serenada/react-ui` via `file:` references to monorepo packages. (PR #47)

- [x] **6.4** Verified: `npm run build` passes for both core and react-ui. All 207 tests pass. (PR #47)

- [x] **6.5** Verified: `client/` app shell builds successfully with `npm run build`. Sample app at `samples/web/` also builds. (PR #47)

---

### 7. Define Versioning Policy

**Why:** All SDKs are at `0.1.0` with no CHANGELOG, migration guide, or stability guarantees. Third-party consumers need to know what's stable, what's experimental, and how breaking changes are communicated.

- [x] **7.1** Created `VERSIONING.md` (35 lines) covering: semver policy, pre-1.0 rules (minor may break, patch is backward-compatible), post-1.0 rules, version synchronization across all 5 packages, breaking change definition, and verification command. Review fix: corrected patch bump example from `0.0.x` to `0.1.x`. (PR #46)

- [x] **7.2** Created `CHANGELOG.md` (24 lines) with initial `0.1.0` entry in Keep a Changelog format, documenting all shipped SDK capabilities. (PR #46)

- [ ] **7.3** ~~Add API stability annotations to public types.~~ Deferred: JSDoc tags, Kotlin annotations, and Swift availability markers are cosmetic and would touch files across all platforms. Will add in a future pass.

- [x] **7.4** Created `scripts/check-version-parity.mjs` (91 lines) checking 7 version sources: TS constant, 2 package.json files, react-ui peerDep on core, 2 Gradle build files, Swift version constant. Review fixes: added react-ui peerDep check, fixed OK print guard to require all sources parsed. Output: `OK: All 7 version sources match at 0.1.0.` (PR #46)

---

## Stage 3 — P2: Quality of Life

These items improve developer experience, robustness, and polish. They can be addressed incrementally after v1.0.

---

### 8. Add Integration Test Harness

**Why:** Unit tests use fakes for speed and determinism, but they can't verify real client-server interaction. The existing smoke test (`tools/smoke-test/smoke-test.sh`) requires physical devices and full Docker. There's no middle layer that tests signaling round-trips against a real server.

**Approach:** Create a lightweight integration test that spins up the Go server in-process (or via Docker), connects two web SDK instances, and verifies the join → offer → answer → connected flow.

- [ ] **8.1** Create `tools/integration-test/` directory with a Node.js test runner.

- [ ] **8.2** Write a server bootstrap script that starts the Go server on a random port with test-mode environment variables (`ROOM_ID_SECRET`, `TURN_SECRET`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*`).

- [ ] **8.3** Write a two-client signaling test:
  - Client A creates a room via `POST /api/room-id`
  - Client A connects via WebSocket, sends `join`
  - Client B connects via WebSocket, sends `join` with same `rid`
  - Verify both receive `joined` with correct participant lists
  - Client A sends `offer` → verify Client B receives it
  - Client B sends `answer` → verify Client A receives it
  - Client A sends `leave` → verify Client B receives `room_state` update

- [ ] **8.4** Write a transport fallback test:
  - Start server with `BLOCK_WEBSOCKET=block`
  - Client connects → verify automatic SSE fallback
  - Verify join flow succeeds over SSE

- [ ] **8.5** Write a reconnect test:
  - Client joins room → server restarts → verify client auto-reconnects and re-joins

- [ ] **8.6** Add to CI pipeline as a separate job (requires Go + Node.js).

---

### 9. Expose `activeTransport` on Android/iOS

**Why:** The web `CallState` exposes `activeTransport: TransportKind | null`, letting the UI show which transport is active. Android/iOS track this internally in `CallDiagnostics` but not in `CallState`. For diagnostic UIs and debugging, this should be consistently accessible.

**Approach:** Rather than adding to `CallState` (which is the public-facing state), document that `activeTransport` is available in `CallDiagnostics` on all platforms, and ensure parity there.

- [ ] **9.1** Verify Android `CallDiagnostics` includes `activeTransport: String?` (should be `"ws"` or `"sse"`). Add if missing.

- [ ] **9.2** Verify iOS `CallDiagnostics` includes `activeTransport: String?`. Add if missing.

- [ ] **9.3** Add `activeTransport` to web `CallDiagnostics` (if a diagnostics type exists) in addition to `CallState`, for consistency.

- [ ] **9.4** Document in sample apps that `session.diagnostics` (Android/iOS) or `session.state.activeTransport` (web) provides transport visibility.

---

### 10. Add WebRTC Capability Detection

**Why:** The web SDK assumes `RTCPeerConnection` exists. On environments without WebRTC (older browsers, restricted WebViews), the SDK throws deep inside `MediaEngine` with no clear error. `SerenadaDiagnostics.probeIceServers()` (line ~333) already checks `typeof RTCPeerConnection === 'undefined'`, but the main join flow doesn't.

- [ ] **10.1** Add a capability check at the top of `SerenadaSession` construction (or in `SerenadaCore.join()`):
  ```typescript
  if (typeof RTCPeerConnection === 'undefined') {
    // Immediately set error state instead of attempting to join
    this.error = { code: 'webrtcUnavailable', message: 'WebRTC is not supported in this browser' };
    this.phase = 'error';
    return;
  }
  ```

- [ ] **10.2** Add `'webrtcUnavailable'` to `CallErrorCode` type (from item 2.1.1).

- [ ] **10.3** Add a static utility `SerenadaCore.isSupported(): boolean` that checks for WebRTC availability without creating a session:
  ```typescript
  static isSupported(): boolean {
    return typeof RTCPeerConnection !== 'undefined'
      && typeof navigator?.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia === 'function';
  }
  ```

- [ ] **10.4** Document the check in the web sample app README.

### 11. Improve CSS Isolation in Web React UI

**Why:** `@serenada/react-ui` injects ~390 lines of CSS into `<head>` at runtime via `callFlowStyles.ts`. This causes specificity conflicts with host apps, prevents SSR, and has no tree-shaking.

**Approach:** Scope all styles under a unique data attribute to minimize conflicts. This is a low-risk incremental improvement over the current approach without requiring a build tool change.

- [ ] **11.1** Add a `data-serenada-callflow` attribute to the root element in `SerenadaCallFlow.tsx`.

- [ ] **11.2** Update all CSS selectors in `callFlowStyles.ts` to be scoped under `[data-serenada-callflow]`:
  ```css
  /* Before */
  .serenada-callflow { ... }
  .serenada-callflow .video-container { ... }

  /* After */
  [data-serenada-callflow] { ... }
  [data-serenada-callflow] .video-container { ... }
  ```

- [ ] **11.3** Add `!important` to critical layout properties (`position`, `width`, `height`, `z-index`) that host app styles are most likely to override accidentally.

- [ ] **11.4** Add a comment at the top of `callFlowStyles.ts` explaining the scoping approach and why shadow DOM was not chosen (incompatibility with video element rendering and fullscreen API).

- [ ] **11.5** Add an optional `className` prop to `SerenadaCallFlow` to allow host apps to add their own class for overrides.

**Total sub-tasks:** 83 checkboxes across 12 items.
**Stage 1 completed:** 2026-03-22. 37/40 checkboxes done, 3 deferred (1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.4 — media control tests requiring deeper MediaEngine integration).
**Stage 2 completed:** 2026-03-22. 26/33 checkboxes done, 7 deferred:
- 4.1.4, 4.2.4: dedicated unit tests for extracted classes (covered indirectly by session tests)
- 4.3.1, 4.3.2: session under 600 lines target (786/854 — reasonable after extraction)
- 4.3.4: cross-platform smoke test (requires physical devices)
- 5.2.3, 5.3.3: dedicated payload parser tests for Android/iOS (covered indirectly)
- 7.3: API stability annotations (cosmetic, deferred)
